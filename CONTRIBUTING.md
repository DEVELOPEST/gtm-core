# Contributing to GTM
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Pull Requests for code changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.  
To purpose a code change do the following:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed something, that should be documented, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
7. If there is any feedback in pull request, do the necessary changes or explain why you did something in a way you did.
8. If everything is good, a maintainer will merge your pull request, and the code will be included in the next release.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue with detailed description!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can (eg. shell script).
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Make sure there are no `gofmt` issues
* Make sure your coding style complies with already existing code
